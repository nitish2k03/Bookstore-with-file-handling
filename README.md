Bookstore in C++ language with file handling
Here is the source code for the project BookStore Management System.I've also used file handling in it.
It is very simple and easy to understand and run.


Language used : C++


Files used : data.dat & temp.dat


Objective :
In our proposed system we maintain the Design Software in an automated form in which the search can
be based on Book Id,. In this system we are going to maintain the Record of different Books
with different details..
The main objective of the C++ Project on Book Store is to manage the details of Book Idâ€™s,
Book Names, Author Names, Price,Stocks.
The objective of the proposed system is that any modification can be made by just the touch of a button
instead of going through the directory and keep on turning pages.
This program consists of six options as follows :
1. To add
2. To show
3. To search
4. To modify
5. To delete
6. To exit program
